# Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Understanding customer preferences and restaurant trends is important for making informed business decisions in the food industry.  
In this project, we analyze Zomato's restaurant dataset using Python to extract meaningful insights such as:

- âœ… Do more restaurants provide online delivery compared to offline services?
- âœ… Which types of restaurants are most favored by the general public?
- âœ… What price range do couples prefer for dining out?
- âœ… How do ratings vary between online and offline orders?

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Steps

1. **Data Import** â€“ Load CSV file into Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Convert `rate` column to float, handle missing values.
3. **Exploratory Analysis** â€“ Identify popular restaurant types, most voted restaurants.
4. **Online vs Offline Orders** â€“ Count and compare availability.
5. **Ratings Analysis** â€“ Distribution and comparison between online & offline orders.
6. **Cost Preferences** â€“ Approximate cost range for two people.
7. **Heatmap** â€“ Restaurant type vs order mode.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

The analysis produces:

* Bar charts of restaurant types
* Votes distribution by type
* Ratings histogram
* Online vs offline order counts
* Cost preference histogram
* Boxplot of ratings by order mode
* Heatmap of restaurant type vs order mode
